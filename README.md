# Helm Kubeval

A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for using [Kubeval](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval) to validate Helm Charts in your workflows.

Supports Helm 3 only.

## Example Workflow

You can use the action as follows:

```yaml
on: push
name: Validate
jobs:
  kubeval:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    - name: test
      uses: desaintmartin/helm-kubeval-action@master
      with:
        path: ./helm-charts
        config: ./config_repos
```

By default the action will:

- Look for each Helm Chart
- For each, look for calues file in its ci directory (otherwise don't use values file)
- run `helm template` and validate the output as Kubernetes objects.

## Inputs

The Helm Kubeval Action has a number of properties which map to the parameters for Kubeval itself. These are
passed to the action using `with`.
